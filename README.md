## Project Overview

The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, class, and more.

## Contents

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and creating new features like AgeGroup and Title.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing survival rates by different categories.
Modeling: Building and evaluating predictive models using the cleaned data.
## How to Use

The Jupyter notebook titanic-survival-predictions.ipynb contains the full workflow.
You can run the notebook locally using Python and Jupyter or on platforms like Google Colab.
## Requirements

Python 3.x
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
